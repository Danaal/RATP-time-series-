# Air quality in subway stations
This project is about predicting gases concentrations such as CO2, PM10 in stations. The data is provided by RATP in the following link https://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/qualite-de-lair-mesuree-dans-la-station-chatelet/export/.
The dataset is for Chatelet station in paris. Sensors measure gases conc.( CO2, NO2, PM10, NO) 24 times a day from 2013 to 2020.
The notebook focus on time series analysis and forcasting using ARIMA and regression modeling based on features using Ridge regression.
